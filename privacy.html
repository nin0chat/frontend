            This privacy policy applies to the nin0chat website and any clients connecting to
            nin0chat. If you never login as a guest or user, absolutely no data is collected on you.
            We only use your data when strictly necessary; it is neither shared nor sold. Last
            updated on 10/20/2024.
            <h2>What do we store</h2>
            If you log in as a guest or create an account:
            <ul>
                <li>A one-way hash of your IP address, kept for security and anti-abuse purposes. This one-way hash allows us to identify your IP address with a unique string generated from it that won't allow finding actual information on the IP</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Additionally, if you do make an account:
            <ul>
                <li>The email and username that were provided</li>
                <li>A one-way hash of the password you gave us</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            If you send a message:
            <ul>
                <li>The message content</li>
                <li>The time the message was sent</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How do we use collected information</h2>
            We only use it for strictly necessary purposes, which are basic functions of the
            nin0chat server and anti-abuse purposes if needed. Your data will never be sold or
            shared to any third-parties, unless absolutely required to do so by law. (if you see
            this message, no data has been shared with any third-party since nin0chat's creation)
            <h2>Data retention</h2>
            We keep your data for as long as you have an account.
            <br />
            If you want your data to be deleted, email
            <a href="mailto:privacy@nin0.dev">privacy@nin0.dev</a> from the account email. If you
            did not make an account, state the used IP address.
            <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
            If we do any changes to the privacy policy, a notice will be shown 60 days before the
            changes are effective and 30 days after they are. The last update date will also always
            be present.
